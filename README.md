git clone https://github.com/arshakshan/Portfolio.git
```

### Navigate to the project directory:

## Usage

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the website on http://localhost:3000.

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build will be stored in the dist directory.
